### Technical Background
It all started my junior year of high school when I took a course in Cybersecurity. There I learned to build computers, make cables, and learned about cyberspace. I knew I wanted to persue cybersecurity. I started learning on my own through Hack The Box and then got the A+ certification last August. In my first semester of college (Winter 2024) I got introduced to Python. Recently, I learned how to code in C using the WSL Ubuntu subsystem.
